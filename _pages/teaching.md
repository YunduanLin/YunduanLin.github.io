**Selected Student Testimonials**

  <span style="color:#0076df;font-weight:420;font-size:14px">
    - I really learn a lot from this course. This is the best course I have ever taken in industry engineering. Maybe I won't give up it if I take this course earlier. <br>
    - Notes are fairly well organized and detailed. I liked that there was separate written lecture notes that was a lot more detailed as compared to the lecture slides which helps with understanding on technical details.<br>
    - She creates very straightforward and creative slides that help understand the topic faster and easier. I also appreciate how she elaborates each example.<br>
    - Instructor Yunduan always encouraged questions and explained the answers in detail.<br>
    - Yunduan is great! Always willing to listen to students' feedback and make reasonable adjustments accordingly.<br>
